		<p> We present Dais, a Glass presentation aid and analytics application. <br /><br />

		<em>The Opportunity</em><br />
		The oral presentation continues to be a crucial medium of communication and learning; however, it's effectiveness is highly subject to execution. Poor execution is well documented - marriage to one's presentation slides, reading off a script, lack of subtle interaction with the audience such as eye contact, and no or too much pacing. As such, workarounds to poor presentation are well known - notecards, timers - but each pose obstacles of their own. Because the ideal oral presentation is known, and the breakdowns of current workarounds are well-observed, there is huge opportunity for a tech rehaul. 

		<br /><br />

		<em>The Solution</em><br />	
		We hope to build a Google Glass application to aid people in giving effective presentation. The solution would be include a few key features â€” presentation remote with timer, and slide advancing, note cards, dynamic eye-contact spread assistance, and recording for post-presentation diagnostics and feedback.
