###Live Presentation feedback and analytics for Google Glass.

####Before presenting, perform the simple calibration steps

* **Tap while looking left and then right.** This stores compass headings which are used to define the boundaries of the audience. 
* **Tap and say the first sentence of your presentation.** This is used to determine the desired speech volume for your presentation. 
* **Tap and remain silent to record background noise.** This is used to determine the floor decibel level of the room. 

####During your presentation, Dais provides (optional) live micro-feedback to help improve your performance

* A **left/right arrow** indicates that you haven't looked at the other side of the audience in a while. 
* An **up arrow** indicates that you've been looking down at your notes for too long, and should look back up at the audience. 
* A **"Face forward!"** prompt indicates that you're facing away from the audience. Useful for slide-based presentations, where it can be tempting to turn your back on your audience and read off your slides. 
* A **"Speak up!"** prompt indicates that the volume of your voice has fallen too far below the ideal speech threshold for your presentation. In other words: stop mumbling. 
* The rest of the time, Dais maintains a blank screen and stays out of your way. 

####After your presentation, view analytics about your performance using Glass or the companion web app

* A heatmap of your head orientation summarizes your visual spread across the audience, and shows you where to focus more next time.
* A line graph of your speech volume over time shows how well you maintained your ideal speech volume. 

####As an open-source app, Dais is ripe for extensions and enhancements:
